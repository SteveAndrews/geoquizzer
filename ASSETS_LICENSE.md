## Rationale (Plain Language)

GeoQuizzer separates licensing for code and content intentionally.

The application code is licensed to support learning, teaching, and nonprofit use while preventing commercial extraction without permission.

The data, maps, and media assets represent substantial research, curation, and creative labor. These assets are licensed under Creative Commons terms to ensure attribution, prevent commercial reuse, and keep educational improvements in the commons.

This separation helps keep GeoQuizzer accessible while protecting the work that went into building it.
